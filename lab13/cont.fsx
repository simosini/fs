(* We have seen how using accumulators some functions become iterative

So far so good.

The bad news is that adding an accumulator does not alwas turn a
recursive function into an iterative one.

Take the case of binary trees

(* but countA is *not* tail recursive according to the definition
above, because you need to recur on the left **and** on the right.

So, stack-wise, we're kind of screwed.

BTW, if you think you can fix this using **two** accumulators, be my guest.

==> What we can do is to use **continuations**.

This is a very general technique that adds a function as an extra
argument to the given procedure, which describes "the rest of the
computation to be performed"

Continuations are very useful in making the flow of control explicit
and thus manipulate the said flow, as we will see later.

In the tail recursion case, suppose we have a function

  f : t1 -> t2

We add an extra argument

  k : t2 → t2

This argument k represents the remaining computation that should be
performed when (f v) terminates. Such function k is called a
continuation. So, the continuation based function has type

fC : t1 -> (t2 -> t2) -> t2.


The basic property is that

       (f v) = (fC v id)
       
where id is the identity function fun x -> x 
-- or more in general something to be done exiting the computation

It's a general result that any function can be translated
(CPS-converted) to a tail recursive one. However, no free lunch: what
you save in stack space, you pay on the heap allocating closures.

// changing the control flow

(*

Consider a function that traverses a list and returns the shortest
prefix of the list such that a predicate p is false on the next
element .  If p holds on all elements, we return None to indicate no
such prefix exists.

let ev = prefix (fun x -> x % 2 = 0) [2;4;5;8]

==>   Some [2; 4]

let no = prefix (fun x -> x % 2 = 0) [2;4;2;8]

==> None

let so = prefix (fun x -> x % 2 = 0) [1;2;4;5;8]

==> Some []
   *)


let consO y = function
  None -> None
  | Some ys -> Some (y :: ys)

let rec prefix p xs =
  match xs with
    | [] -> None
    | y :: ys ->
      if p y then consO y (prefix p ys)  else (Some  [])

let ev = prefix (fun x -> x % 2 = 0) [2;4;5;8]
let no = prefix (fun x -> x % 2 = 0) [2;4;2;8]
let so = prefix (fun x -> x % 2 = 0) [1;2;4;5;8]

(*

Note an inefficiency in this function: if p is is true for every
element in the list, consO is called on every element after the end
of the list has been reached, passing along None all the way up to be
returned as the overall result.

ex:  prefix (fun x -> x % 2 = 0) [2;4;2;8]

==> consO 2 (cons0 4 (cons0 2 (cons0 8 None)))) ==> None

Instead, we would like to return None immediately once we have reached
the end of the list and found no element on which p is false.

We do this CPS style, where:

- we use as initial continuation a variant of id, i.e.  (fun r -> Some r)

- in the “success” case (we find an element where p is false)
we call the continuation cont on the expected answer ( [] in this
program).

- In the case of a “failure” (we do not find a place where p is false)
we discard the continuation and return directly (with None in this
program)

to be seen in another lecture.
