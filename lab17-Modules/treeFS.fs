module  FSet

// we use binary search trees as an alternative implementation of sets

type 'a FSet = Leaf | Node of 'a * 'a FSet * 'a FSet

// First, a technicality
let (.<) small big = 
      match (Unchecked.compare small big) with
      | -1 ->  true 
      | _ ->   false;;


(* why do we redefine comparison? In general this is *not* a good idea,
as it will allow to compare things that we should not
compare such as functions. However, here we would need 'a to be both 

'a : comparison and 
'a : equality

for this implementation, and this mean multiple inheritance 

So we suppress the static check using Uncheched.equals
