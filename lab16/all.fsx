   In, fact generators start with small numbers and gradually
increase them. This is controlled by the StartSize and EndSize
settings. By default, StartSize is 1 and EndSize is 100. So at the end
of the test, the "size" parameter to the generator will be 100.  *)

// MONITORING

// Arguments exhausted after *** tests.

(* It is important to be aware of the distribution of test cases: if
   test data is not well distributed then conclusions drawn from the
   test results may be invalid. In particular, the ==> operator can
   skew the distribution of test data badly, since only test data
   which satisfies the given condition is used.

   FsCheck offers some combinator to observe the distribution. Just
put them in the test itself *)

// Counting Trivial Cases: how many tests just consider lists that are empty or singleton?

do Check.Quick prop_remord_tr

(*
There are two (inter-related) issues here:

1. This checks are conditional and have **hard-to-satisfy** premises

  ordered xs ==> P xs

  the likelihood that a list of 3 elements is ordered is 33%, hence
    the reply "Arguments exhausted after 55 tests", meaning that we have reached
    the MaxFail threshold while producing 55 test that survive

2. Of the instances that survive the precondition, it is no suprise that they
have very short length and are not that interesting.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

 How to make random testing more effective is a hot research topic in
 FP testing. One can

- drop random testing and shift to *exhaustive* testing, or even
  symbolic execution ("narrowing")
    ===> (Lazy)SmallCheck

- Use logic programming techique to improve test generation

   ===> SparseCheck, smart generators in Isabelle/HOL

- Find "deeper" enumeration techniques

 ===> Feat

 Here we just follow the QuickCheck approach, that is, we explain how
 to write **custom made** generators

 1. In particular we can write generators so that we can quantify only over certain specific domains

 2. We can change probability distribution to suit our needs
   *)



// But wait!  naive fix: increase the number of tests that can fail

let config3 = {
    Config.Quick with 
        MaxFail = 1000
    }


do Check.One(config3, prop_remord_tr)

// it takes forever and coverage does not gen any better


(* It's better to write a custom generator.

FsCheck gives you generator for primitive types and then lift them up
to discriminated unions. All these combinators live in the modules Gen
and Arb, where the latter package up generators with shrinkers (more later).

Bottomline: use Gen for generating random data, Arb for generators to
go into properties (with shrinkers)

There are many ways to write generators and we'll stick to the minimum

*)


// Arb.generate<'a> returns the generator of the registered Arbitrary
// instance for the given type 'a. This is type driven and easy to use

let intGenerator = Arb.generate<int>  

// To see what's going on we use Gen.sample. 
// generate three ints with a maximum size of 100
let js = Gen.sample 100 3 intGenerator 

// Then you can lift it to compound types, and this is what FsCheck does under the hood

// generate 10 int lists with a maximum size of 5
let intListGenerator = Arb.generate<int list>

let iss = Gen.sample 5 10 intListGenerator 

// The best thing is that the generator will work with your own user-defined types too!

type Color = Red | Green of int | Blue of bool

let colorGenerator = Arb.generate<Color>

// generate 10 colors with a maximum size of 50 (for ints)
let cs = Gen.sample 50 10 colorGenerator 


(* Now, we can use some combinators to filter what we want from
generators. 

Arb.from<'a> Get the Arbitrary instance for the given type. Like Arb.generate, but yielding a Arb not a Gen

Arb.filter : (('a -> bool) -> Arbitrary<'a> -> Arbitrary<'a>)

   filters the generator and shrinker for a given Arbitrary instance
   to contain only those values that match with the given filter function


Arb.mapFilter : (('a -> 'a) -> ('a -> bool) -> Arbitrary<'a> -> Arbitrary<'a>)

   Arb.mapFilter maps the generator and filter the shrinkers for a
   given Arbitrary instance. Mapping the generator is sometimes
   faster than to filter

   *)


  
let orderedArb =
  Arb.filter ordered Arb.from<int list>

// let's look at this

let look arb = 
    arb |> Arb.toGen |> Gen.sample 500 10 

let os = look orderedArb
   
// OK, we could do better (less empties)

let orderedNEArb =
  Arb.filter (fun xs -> ordered xs &&  List.isEmpty xs |> not) Arb.from<int list>

let eos = look orderedNEArb


// the one from the book
let orderedMapArb =
  Arb.mapFilter List.sort ordered Arb.from<list<int>>

let bs = look orderedMapArb

// Now, how can we say to QC to use this generator, rather than the standard one?

// use Prop.forAll :  (Arbitrary<'a> -> ('a -> 'b) -> Property) 
// Quantified property combinator. Provide a custom test data generator to a property.
// back to conditional properties : forall xs : ordered Px as:


let prop_insertWithArb arb (x : int) =
  Prop.forAll arb (fun xs -> ordered(insert (x, xs)))
         
do Check.Quick <| prop_insertWithArb orderedArb
do Check.Quick <| prop_insertWithArb orderedNEArb

// note: no test exhaustion. Now let's see coverage
let prop_insertWithArbCollect arb x =
  Prop.forAll arb (fun xs -> ordered(insert (x, xs)) |> Prop.collect (List.length xs))
do Check.Quick (prop_insertWithArbCollect orderedNEArb)

// this give the best distribution
do Check.Quick (prop_insertWithArbCollect orderedMapArb)
// not too shabby


// other examples

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Controlling data distribution:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Sometimes we want to have generators with a *bias*, that is, we give
to some constructor a higher likelihood to be generated. E.g. in a
tree we want more nodes than leaves. In an arithmetic expression more
variables than constants.

We can control the distribution of results using the *frequency*
combinator. frequency chooses a generator from the list randomly, but
weighs the probability of choosing each alternative by the factor
given.
